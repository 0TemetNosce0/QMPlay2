QMPlay2 compilation tutorial.

You need (devel packages):
	- ffmpeg >= 2.0 (>= 2.4 recommended) (libavcodec, libavformat, libavutil, libswscale, libswresample or libavresample*, OpenSSL for https)
	- portaudio (default on non-Linux OS, if you want to compile portaudio module on Linux, change "src/modules/modules.pro")
	- pulseaudio (optional, if you don't want to compile pulseaudio on Linux, remove it from "src/modules/modules.pro")
	- taglib >= 1.7 (>= 1.9 recommended) (you can disable it in "src/gui/gui.pro")
	- Qt4 or Qt5 (including QtOpenGL, OpenSSL for https and QtDBus on Linux/BSD)
	- libva (vaapi) and libvdpau - only on X11
	- libasound (for ALSA module on Linux)
	- DirectDraw SDK - only on Windows
	- libcdio and libcddb
	- libxv - only on X11
	- libass
*libavresample:
	Uncomment last three lines in "src/qmplay2/qmplay2.pro"

Running compilation script:
	Windows (Cross-compile):
		- install all required MinGW packages (I recommend ArchLinux unofficial MinGW repository),
		- some libraries are incompatible, uses unneeded libraries or doesn't exists in repository - you must built them on your own,
		- notice that QMPlay2 uses static linking for some libraries,
		- run compile_win_cross
		You can also compile it on Windows, but you must build toolchain for your own!
		I'm using my own PKGBUILDs for many MinGW libraries.
		Visual Studio can't compile QMPlay2.
	Linux/BSD:
		- if you don't want to open Xterm or Konsole - "export NOTERM=1",
		- if you want to prepare *.desktop files for system use - "export SYSTEM_BUILD=1",
		- if you want to compile with qt suffix (for example "qmake-qt5") - "export QT_SUFFIX=-qt5",
		- run compile_unix,
		- QMPlay2 is in "app" directory, you can move its contents into /usr directory if $SYSTEM_BUILD == 1

Building package RPM, DEB or any other - look at ArchLinux PKGBUILD: http://aur.archlinux.org/packages/qm/qmplay2/PKGBUILD

QMPlay2 uses the external software - "youtube-dl", so "youtube-dl" should be as optional package in package manager.
